🎨 AI Image Upscaling Web App
This is a unique web application created to allow users to upload images and receive a simulated upscaled version. The project is structured with a separated front-end and back-end, providing a solid foundation for building a fully functional image upscaling service.
✨ Key Features
 * Unique UI: A modern and visually appealing user interface designed using HTML and custom CSS.
 * Image Upload: Users can upload image files directly from their browser.
 * Python Backend: A REST API built with Python and Flask ready to receive and process image data.
 * Simulated Processing: The back-end code simulates the image upscaling process, demonstrating how the front-end and back-end communicate.
⚙️ Tech Stack
Front-end:
 * HTML: For the page structure.
 * CSS: For all the unique styling and animations.
 * JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and communication with the backend API.
Back-end:
 * Python: The core language for the server.
 * Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the API.
Deployment:
 * Front-end: Deployed on Netlify.
 * Back-end: Deployed on Railway.
🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.
Prerequisites
 * Python 3 installed.
 * A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
 * Git installed.
Front-end Setup 📁
 * Ensure you have two files in your project folder: index.html and script.js.
 * index.html contains the page layout and styling.
 * script.js handles form submission and communication with the back-end.
Back-end Setup 🐍
 * Ensure you have two files in the same folder: app.py and requirements.txt.
 * Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder.
 * Install the required Python libraries by running this command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Start the server by running:
   python app.py

   The server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
🌐 Deployment
The project is designed to be deployed with a separated front-end and back-end.
 * Deploy the Front-end: Upload your index.html and script.js files to a hosting service like Netlify.
 * Deploy the Back-end: Push your app.py and requirements.txt files to a GitHub repository and deploy it on a platform like Railway.
 * Connect Them: Once your back-end is live on Railway, you'll get a public URL. You must update the serverUrl variable in your script.js file with this new URL, then re-upload the front-end to Netlify.
🚀 Future Improvements
 * Implement Real Upscaling: Integrate a machine learning library (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) or an API to perform actual image upscaling on the back-end. 📈
 * Error Handling: Add more robust error handling for file types, sizes, and server-side issues. ⚠️
 * User Interface: Add a progress bar or loading spinner to enhance the user experience during processing. ✨
 * File Management: Implement logic to store and manage upscaled images on the server. 💾
