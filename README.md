AI Image Upscaling Web Application 🖥️
This is a web application that allows users to upload an image and receive a simulated upscaled version. The project is structured with a front-end for user interaction and a Python-based backend to handle the processing logic.
This codebase serves as a solid foundation for building a fully functional image upscaling service. While the provided backend code simulates the upscaling process, it is structured to be easily integrated with a real upscaling library or API.
Features
 * Unique UI: A modern and unique user interface built with HTML and CSS. 🎨
 * Image Upload: Users can upload image files directly from their browser. 🖼️
 * Backend API: A simple REST API built with Python and Flask to receive and process image data. ⚙️
 * Simulated Processing: The server-side code includes a simulated upscaling process, demonstrating how the front-end and back-end communicate. 🚀
Technology Stack
Frontend: 💻
 * HTML: For the page structure.
 * CSS: For all the unique styling and animations.
 * JavaScript: For client-side interactivity and communication with the backend API.
Backend: 🧠
 * Python: The core language for the server.
 * Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the API.
Deployment: ☁️
 * Frontend: Deployed on Netlify.
 * Backend: Deployed on Railway.
Getting Started ✅
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.
Prerequisites
 * Python 3 installed
 * A code editor (like VS Code)
 * Git installed
Frontend Setup 📁
 * Ensure you have two files in your project folder: index.html and script.js.
 * The index.html file contains the page structure and styling.
 * The script.js file handles the form submission and communicates with the backend.
Backend Setup 🐍
 * Ensure you have two files in the same folder: app.py and requirements.txt.
 * Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder.
 * Install the required Python libraries by running this command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
 * Start the backend server by running:
   python app.py
   The server will start running locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Deployment 🚀
The project is designed to be deployed with a separated front-end and back-end.
 * Deploy the Frontend: Upload your index.html and script.js files to a hosting service like Netlify.
 * Deploy the Backend: Push your app.py and requirements.txt files to a GitHub repository and deploy it to a platform like Railway.
 * Connect the Two: Once your backend is live on Railway, you'll get a public URL. You must update the serverUrl variable in your script.js file with this new URL and then re-upload the front-end to Netlify.
Future Improvements 💡
 * Implement Real Upscaling: Integrate a machine learning library (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) or an API to perform actual image upscaling on the backend. 📈
 * Error Handling: Add more robust error handling for file types, sizes, and server-side issues. ⚠️
 * User Interface: Add a progress bar or loading spinner to enhance the user experience during processing. ✨
 * File Management: Implement logic to store and manage upscaled images on the server. 💾
